Travelmaker - Tripadvisor clone
============

This is a Travel agency site.

The project mainly focuses on recreating the layout of TripAdvisor's homepage. The site is responsive, I tried to replicate the performance of the original. For the construction I used mainly CSS (Media queries, Flexbox, Grid), HTML and Flickity- a responsive, touch-sensitive carousel. Photos are mostly from http://www.unsplash.com and http://www.freepik.com.
