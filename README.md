Travelmaker - Tripadvisor clone
============

//// Please note, this project is still in progress!

This is a Travel agency site.

The project mainly focuses on recreating
the layout of Tripadvisor's homepage. I tried to replicate the
responsiveness and look of the
original. For the project I used mainly CSS (Media
queries, Flexbox, Grid), HTML, Flickity- a responsive, touch carousel
and some JavaScript to make it even more
consistent with the assumption of the RWD. Photos are mostly come
from <a href="http://www.unsplash.com">unsplash</a> and one (search
banner) from <a href="http://www.freepik.com">freepik</a>.
